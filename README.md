# Solar Energy – Building Energy Analysis (CA1 Coursework Project)

This repository presents a building energy performance analysis and retrofit study conducted using MEPworx and Excel-based calculations.  
The project assesses the thermal losses, annual heating demand, hot water use, ventilation energy, summer overheating risk, Building Energy Rating (BER), and the impact of renewable integration.

## Project Overview

- Software: MEPworx + Excel  
- Focus: Whole-building energy performance before and after retrofit  
- Objectives:  
  1. Calculate heat losses through fabric and infiltration  
  2. Determine hot water demand and ventilation loads  
  3. Estimate annual thermal and electrical energy use  
  4. Evaluate summer overheating risks in high-gain zones  
  5. Assess primary energy demand and Building Energy Rating (BER)  
  6. Integrate rooftop PV and calculate renewable contribution

## Key Results

- Heat Loss Reduction: Retrofit reduced annual heating demand by ~72%  
- Electricity Savings: Retrofit halved building electrical consumption (~50%)  
- Primary Energy: Improved from ~186.65 → 41.71 kWh/m²·yr  
- BER Improvement: Upgraded to a much higher rating post-retrofit  
- Renewable Integration: A 23,100 kWh/yr rooftop PV array could fully cover annual electrical demand
